# iLIR-ML-data

This repository contains computer code (including Python notebooks), Machine Lerning Models and data files related to the prediction of functional LIR motifs based on data deposited in the [LIRcentral database](https://lircentral.eu).


An online, freely available Python Notebook implementing the iLIR-ML method (v0.9) can be accessed online at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FjK2nR9gFtELOoBwvPDKicvkzV-2flhA?usp=sharing).

The iLIR_AF2disorder.ipynb notebook, contains code performing exploratory data analysis using features from Alphafold-disorder (Piovesan et al., 2021) and custom made PSSM profiles representing positive and negative instances of LIR motifs.
